Aim:
To turn a LED on and off using switch.
Theory:
Analysing the concept of switch.
How we can turn a LED on and off using a push button on a switch on Arduino board and breadboard.
Learning and observations:
After connecting all the wires with Arduino and breadboard and the USB cables along with a switch the led glows when the switch is pressed.
Problems and troubleshooting:
1.Loose connection of cables.
2.Loose connections of LED bulbs.
3.Error in programming or coding.
Precautions:
While unplugging the USB ,pull the plug not the cable.
Connections should be tight and according to the coding done on Arduino software.
Handle the apparatus like AUDRINO BOARD, LED wires and breadboard carefully.
Learning Outcomes:
Working and appearance of Arduino.
Lighting of LED using Arduino board and software and switch.
Design and analysis of breadboard along with its circuit diagram.
